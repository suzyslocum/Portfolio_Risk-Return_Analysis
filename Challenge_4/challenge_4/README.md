# Whale Portfolio Risk-Return Analysis

This is a python application written with Pandas in Jupyter Lab that reads in a csv file containing data collected from four different portfolios and the S&P 500. This data allows us to analyze the risk-return profile of each portfolio so that we may make recommendations on which would be good investments.
